The speed PID is set first through manual tunning.

The steer PID parameters are initially tuned manually, following the order of kp, kd, ki. The parameters are than fine tuned with twiddle to help ensure a good over all error and that the cte never exceeds 2.5. The current steer parameters are tuned with a low target speed setting.

A video of the first success run is "demo.mp4".
